House the update code, to be curled regularly

Update code includes everything that is done with web3 on the old site
  - querying card and vending machine info
  - the lookup and gallery tools


Note: Total supply can be found in contractInst.totalSupply().toString();, but its not accurate for the first 14 cards, so lets hard code supply for now
