Bugs:
- (bug) fix the weird half second lockup delay on index page load. only in ffox?

Current - eth update in db
1) Make ruby that fetches all the info from api
2) Sanitize date from sql injection and insert it in to the db
3) Stats page that says when the last time this happened was
4) devise system to trigger fetch when its been to long. See update notes in top ToDo.

ToDo:
- Switch the client side JS web3 fetching with db info. Possible methods to update the db info:
    - Create js caching system
        - User requests page, system checks how long since the last update
        - if its been recently enough, page loads normal
        - If its been over an amount of time, it runs js to fetch all the web3 stuff
        - the stuff is put into the db, and timestamped
        - page loads
    - Make a 'go get stuff' endpoint
        - setup a server to curl that endpoint at regular times
        - have a status page that shows the last time the curl happened
    - Endpoint, but...
        - use a site that monitors for change as the curler, like https://visualping.io/

- Switch cardwrapper price to show from DB
- Remove buying addresses, untill after upgrade
- Address the todo's in the cardImage helper
- Add 404 page (example: invalid artist url)
- Add signature check and/or local files for all css and external resources
    - Don't forget about css and etc loaded in the application view
- Test on mobile
- Change how card info is shown:
    - make flip over?
    - add banner edge on bottom ala new mockups?
    - hybrid?
- Add how-to page (about view)

- Look through db calls in scope and etc and add limits
    - limit 1 means it stops searching after ti find 1, not that it only searches the first 1

Wishlist:
- Add 'all cards' page
- Add 'single card' page
- Check if valid username or card id before loading user or card page
    - # Card.by_artist("robekworld").exists checks if valid username faster than .present?
    - Card.first, Card.last, check id, defined as range.
- If no jpg or png or gif avalible, pull from ipfs
- Switch card wrapper to flexbox (currently managed in unsorted)
    - delete all the old 'media type' css styles for the cards
    - delete card-container stuff from the unsorted css
- Sort and delete the unsorted css file
- Switch gallery over to local images, not ipfs
    - Have ipfs links
    - Insert a 'load from ipfs' button to clear and pull them the old way
- Metamask
    - Impliment Metamask buying
    - add how to migrate old card keys to Metamask
    - get rid of old wallet, dehost
