Bugs:
- (bug) fix the weird half second lockup delay on index page load. only in ffox?
- Cards are not in order under there date grouping (look at phneep)

Current - eth update in db

4) devise system to trigger fetch when its been to long. See update notes in top ToDo.

Primary Tasks:
- add https://visualping.io/ update trigger

ToDo:
- make these changes: https://www.viget.com/articles/heroku-cloudflare-the-right-way/
- custom 404 pages 
    - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-pages
    - https://medium.com/@tair/custom-error-pages-in-rails-you-re-doing-it-wrong-ba1d20ec31c0
- switch to 'sold out' if 0 vend supply
- db data accurate? some of the update data might be wrong, like supply on 1-14
- put in "@var ||= thing" where ever can cache assignments, like in the web3 code. If done before, don't do again just use previous
    - Does this not work? putting the following in controller shows its still running the db call each time and not remembering:
        puts @last
        @last ||= Card.last(3) 
        puts @last
- Insert a delay into the active lookups. time how long it takes.
- convert lookup page to js vs. ruby mode
- fix layout css call
- Switch cardwrapper price to show from DB
- Remove buying addresses, untill after upgrade
- Address the todo's in the cardImage helper
- Add 404 page (example: invalid artist url)
- Add signature check and/or local files for all css and external resources
    - Don't forget about css and etc loaded in the application view
- Test on mobile
- Change how card info is shown:
    - make flip over?
    - add banner edge on bottom ala new mockups?
    - hybrid?
- Add how-to page (about view)
- Look through db calls in scope and etc and add limits
    - limit 1 means it stops searching after ti find 1, not that it only searches the first 1
- general security review: check out rails security best practices, search all app for issues

- convert cardwrapper to flxbox
    - translate css changes to single view's image div madness, which currently is copied from cardwrapper
- give vend price to cards 1-10, so the single card views 'inital vend price' makes sense

Wishlist:
- Add 'all cards' page
- Add 'single card' page
- Check if valid username or card id before loading user or card page
    - # Card.by_artist("robekworld").exists checks if valid username faster than .present?
    - Card.first, Card.last, check id, defined as range.
- If no jpg or png or gif avalible, pull from ipfs. check localforge cache before fetching.
- Switch card wrapper to flexbox (currently managed in unsorted)
    - delete all the old 'media type' css styles for the cards
    - delete card-container stuff from the unsorted css
- Sort and delete the unsorted css file
- Switch gallery over to local images, not ipfs
    - Have ipfs links
    - Insert a 'load from ipfs' button to clear and pull them the old way
- Metamask
    - Impliment Metamask buying
    - add how to migrate old card keys to Metamask
    - get rid of old wallet, dehost
- Create user update trigger to remove dependance on visualping
    - Page loads normal for user, but background process starts:
        - checks how long since the last update
        - If its been over an amount of time, triggers update
        - update recorded in stats
