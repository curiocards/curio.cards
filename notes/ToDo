Bugs:
- (bug) fix the weird half second lockup delay on index page load. only in ffox?

ToDo:
- Switch cardwrapper price to show from DB
- Clean up artist list on index
- Address the todo's in the cardImage helper
- Add 404 page (example: invalid artist url)
- Add signature check and/or local files for all css and external resources
    - Don't forget about css and etc loaded in the application view
- Break out index defs in controller to private methods
- Add a max width to the artist details box
- Make the How To Buy line text bigger, same as the other titles
- Test on mobile
- Change how card info is shown:
    - make flip over?
    - add banner edge on bottom ala new mockups?
    - hybrid?
- Add how-to page (about view)
- Switch the client side JS web3 fetching with db info. Possible methods to update the db info:
    - Create js caching system
        - User requests page, system checks how long since the last update
        - if its been recently enough, page loads normal
        - If its been over an amount of time, it runs js to fetch all the web3 stuff
        - the stuff is put into the db, and timestamped
        - page loads
    - Make a 'go get stuff' endpoint
        - setup a server to curl that endpoint at regular times
        - have a status page that shows the last time the curl happened
    - Endpoint, but...
        - use a site that monitors for change as the curler, like https://visualping.io/
- Look through db calls in scope and etc and add limits
    - limit 1 means it stops searching after ti find 1, not that it only searches the first 1

Wishlist:
- Add 'all cards' page
- Add 'single card' page
- Check if valid username or card id before loading user or card page
    - # Card.by_artist("robekworld").exists checks if valid username faster than .present?
    - Card.first, Card.last, check id, defined as range.
- If no jpg or png or gif avalible, pull from ipfs
- Switch card wrapper to flexbox (currently managed in unsorted)
    - delete all the old 'media type' css styles for the cards
    - delete card-container stuff from the unsorted css
- Sort and delete the unsorted css file
- Switch gallery over to local images, not ipfs
    - Have ipfs links
    - Insert a 'load from ipfs' button to clear and pull them the old way
- Metamask
    - Impliment Metamask buying
    - add how to migrate old card keys to Metamask
    - get rid of old wallet, dehost
